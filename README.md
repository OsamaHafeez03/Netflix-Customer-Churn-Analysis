# Netflix-Customer-Churn-Analysis
The most critical number on the dashboard: the Churn Rate. At 50.3%, this represents a significant concern for our business. We also see that we've lost 2,515 customers, resulting in a revenue loss of $33,010.

## Churn Rate by Subscription Type
The bar chart on the top left indicates that our Basic plan has the highest churn rate, at over 60%. This is our first clue. It suggests that customers on our most affordable plan are the most likely to leave.

## Churned Customers by Region
The map visual provides a geographical context. We can immediately see that South America has a high concentration of churned customers. This is an actionable insight.

## Churned Customers by Age Group and Gender
 The bar chart on the right gives us a demographic breakdown. Customers above 45 are the largest group of churned customers. This is another key piece of our puzzle. We also see that there's a relatively even split between male and female churn. This suggests our content or marketing strategy might not be resonating with this older demographic.

 ## Churned Customers by Payment Method
 It reveals that the "Crypto" payment method has a 100% churn rate, and "Gift Card" is also very high. This is a powerful insight. It suggests that customers using these less traditional or one-off payment methods are not our long-term, loyal subscribers. 

 ## Churn Rate by Device
 Shows us where customers are accessing our service. Mobile and Laptop users have the highest churn rates. This could be due to a poor user experience on these devices.

 ## Churn Rate by Favorite Genre
  It shows that there is a high churn rate across all genres, but Sci-Fi and Horror have slightly higher churn. This might indicate a lack of recent or compelling content in these specific categories, which could be a factor in why those fans are leaving.

  ## Conclusion
We now know that our highest churn rates are with our Basic plan customers, in South America, who are over 45, pay with crypto or gift cards, and primarily use mobile or laptop devices.

##  Call to Action
### Investigate the high churn in South America.

### Develop a content strategy or marketing campaign to better engage with the 45+ age demographic.

### Analyze the user experience on mobile and laptop devices.

### Re-evaluate the value proposition of the Basic plan.

### Consider whether to continue accepting "Crypto" and "Gift Card" payments, or to create targeted campaigns for these users to encourage them to switch to a more permanent payment method.
